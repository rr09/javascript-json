# javascript-json
##### This repository consists of two problems:

1. Imagine you are creating a JSON data store for a Ecommerce platform like
flipkart.com or amazon.in. Create a JSON to show what fields you will choose
and what type of data (string/object/array) would you want to store in those field.

2. Consider the following JSON dataset -

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.j
son

This dataset contains information of all characters (pokemon) of a famous game
Pokemon Go. Include this dataset in a JS file as a variable and then write the following
functions:
- Write a function to take pokemon’s name as argument and display the
information of that pokemon
- Write a function that takes pokemon’s name as an argument and find out
which all pokemon have that name in their “next_evolution” field.
- Write a function that take a “Weakness” as an input and gives the names
of all pokemon who have that Weakness. (check the weakness array in
the dataset)
