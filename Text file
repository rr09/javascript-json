Problem 1

The attached JSON file consists of an array of objects. The objects are productDetails, orderDetails, CustomerDetails,cartDetails 
and paymentDetails. Within each of these objects we have objects with keys productId, productName, productPrice, etc. The values of these keys are numbers, strings, 
objects and arrays.


Problem 2

1. 
To search the name of the Pokemon, we use a for in loop to check through the names of each object of the pokemon array and 
compare it with the inputted pokemon name. If they match, we display the information of that pokemon. Else we display an alert that says "Pokemon not 
found".

2.
We search for the names of pokemon in the next evolution field using two for in loops;one for the pokemon array and the other for the next evolution array.
If the inputted pokemon is present in the next evolution array within the pokemon  array, we display the names of those pokemon that have the inputted pokemon
in their next evolution field. Else we say "No pokemon has the inputted pokemon in their “next_evolution” field".

3. 
First we search for the names of the weakness from the weaknesses array using two for in loops. The outer for in loop is for the pokemon array 
and the inner one is to loop through the weaknesses array. We then compare the input with the array and if the match is found we display the list 
of those pokemon names that have the inputted weakness. Else we display an alert that says "Invalid weakness".
